		<!-- About Me Paragraphs -->

		<p>Charles is inquisitive.  Nuff Said?</p>  

		<p>No topic is too boring and no words are too dull to read, labels included!  Charles simply can't ignore the rabbit-holes of the web and no topic may go undiscovered ...<em>even those he regrets</em>.  Despite not being much of a drinker, he is a trivia powerhouse and could be a MVP if you're looking to draft him for your bar trivia team.
		</p>

		<p>Charles's past is littered with regrets.  These ranging from a history degree, a middle grades teaching job and even a master's in education from NCSU for which he's hoplessly in debt.  While these experiences have allowed him to grow into the person he is today, he can't help but think there might have been a better way to get here.
		</p>

		<p>This hasn't deterred him from continuing his education though.  Today, Charles can be found studying web development at the UNC-CH Coding Bootcamp. Perhaps with a little luck, he will finally achieve the American Dream of eating something besides ramen and hot dogs.
		</p>
